# TfLite

The package I've selected to facilitate the loading and execution of TensorFlow Lite models directly on the device is `tflite_flutter`.

The `tflite_flutter` package is a Flutter plugin for accessing TensorFlow Lite API. It provides a simple, high-level API for running TensorFlow Lite models in a Flutter app. This package supports both image-based models and natural language processing models, and it can run models both on-device and in the cloud.

With `tflite_flutter`, you can easily load a TensorFlow Lite model from assets, run inference on input data, and get the output. The package also provides utilities for converting between Dart types and the types used by TensorFlow Lite.

Here are some of the key features of `tflite_flutter`:

- Easy to use: The package provides a simple, high-level API that abstracts away the details of the TensorFlow Lite API.
- Flexible: The package supports both image-based models and natural language processing models, and it can run models both on-device and in the cloud.
- Efficient: The package uses the TensorFlow Lite API directly, without any additional overhead.
